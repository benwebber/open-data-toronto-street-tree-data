# open-data-toronto-street-tree-data

A history of Toronto's urban canopy.

This is a [Git scraping](https://simonwillison.net/series/git-scraping/) mirror of Toronto's [catalogue of city-owned street trees](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/street-tree-data/) data.

Because GitHub limits individual files to 100 MiB, the data is partitioned into smaller files by ID[^1].

|Filename|Description|
|---|---|
|`street-tree-data-00.csv`|Numeric IDs|
|`street-tree-data-ET.csv`|IDs starting with `ET` (Etobicoke)|
|`street-tree-data-EY.csv`|IDs starting with `EY` (East York)|
|`street-tree-data-NY.csv`|IDs starting with `NY` (North York)|
|`street-tree-data-SC.csv`|IDs starting with `SC` (Scarborough)|
|`street-tree-data-TO.csv`|IDs starting with `TO` (Toronto)|
